# Traffic Sign Recognition System using Deep Learning

This project is a computer vision-based deep learning model that recognizes and classifies traffic signs from real-world images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset to identify traffic signs accurately and efficiently.
